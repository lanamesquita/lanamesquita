## 💻✨ Hi there! I'm Lana Mesquita!

**💻 Software Engineer | 📚 Professor | ✨ UX & Accessibility Advocate | 🎓 M.Sc. in Computer Science** 
<!-- | 💼 Professor at Federal University of Ceará -->

Since 2012, I’ve worked in computing and systems development, with roles as a developer, project manager, and UX designer. As a Professor of web and mobile development, I teach JavaScript, React, and React Native, focusing on accessible, user-centered applications. 

🧠 I believe that excellent software comes from understanding not only the technical requirements but also the human and social aspects behind every interaction.
